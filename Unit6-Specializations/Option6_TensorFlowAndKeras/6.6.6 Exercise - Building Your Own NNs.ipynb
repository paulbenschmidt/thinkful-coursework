    "Now take your Keras skills and go build another neural network. Pick your data set, but it should be one of abstract types, possibly even nonnumeric, and use Keras to make five implementations of your network. Compare them both in computational complexity as well as in accuracy and given that tradeoff decide which one you like best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset should be sufficiently large for a neural network to perform well (samples should really be in the thousands here) and try to pick something that takes advantage of neural networks’ ability to have both feature extraction and supervised capabilities, so don’t pick something with an easy to consume list of features already generated for you (though neural networks can still be useful in those contexts).\n",

    "Note that if you want to use an unprocessed image dataset, [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) is a useful package for converting to importable numerics."
